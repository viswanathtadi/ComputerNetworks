I chose python firstly beacuse there is some string handling to be done in the routing protocol messages.Python makes this easier.

I needed to learn how to send and receive udp messages in python.This is not difficult.

I needed to learn multi-threading in python so as to run multiple processes simultaneously.

I learnt the dijstras algorithm using the resources like gfg.

I studied the ospf algorithm and differnent messaging protocols in it.I implemented the hello,helloreply and lsa packets.

Finally I needed to print the routing table of each router to its corresponding output file.
